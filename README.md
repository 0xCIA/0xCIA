### Cypherpunk's Manifesto
>We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems.  We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.
>
>Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it.
